# Fourier-transform-localization
This paper illustrates an introduction to Fourier transform and its application to engineering fields, 
including an application to time-frequency analysis and feature extraction. 
This paper demonstrates the denoising ability of Fourier transform through an application in detecting a marble’s location
inside a dog’s intestine through ultrasound data (fake data). 
This paper gives an overview and intuition of Fourier transform and its properties to be used widely
in various engineering fields, including application in time-series data analysis and feature extraction. 
Many natural phenomenons exhibits wave properties such as sound, light or even quantum particles, 
therefore, Fourier transform revolutionizes the way we observe the data in a more natural way of how things work.  
Generally, it is often extremely useful to know what components is the data consists of so that it will be easier to 
understand its behaviour and properties when combined the elements together. Furthermore, understanding the features
will give us a chance of creating similar datasets which is really helpful when generating training data for machine learning
models or image processing techniques.
